                <p>SMART COOKING HAS NEVER BEEN SO EASY TO GET TO GRIPS WITH.</p>
                <h1> <strong> It’s in </strong> your hands. </h1>
                <p>The Celsius°Cooking™ system puts fine-tuned, technical control in the palm of your hand –
                    literally. Now you have the power to change, define, and monitor the temperatures and timings
                    of the food you cook with a new level of precision. And with the connected pan, hob, and probe,
                    the enjoyably hands-on experience of working on the hob becomes a finely-tuned culinary
                    adventure. Celsius°Cooking™ equipment links directly to the companion app from Hestan Cue
                    that not only allows you to set, control, and monitor temperatures and timings but which is also
                    home to a large collection of inspirational step-by-step recipes. Not only will this inspire you to
                    make something delicious, but it’s also the best way to learn how to use the Celsius°Cooking™
                    system: by getting your hands on it and seeing what it can really do</p>

        <h2>The probe.</h2>
        <p>Celsius°Cooking™ measures temperatures at the bottom of the
            connected pots and pans – both when frying, and when simmering
            delicate sauces that can easily catch or burn – and through a probe
            that can be put directly into the food. It is a sophisticated piece of
            technology that lets you measure your foods temperature very precisely</p>
